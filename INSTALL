How to build the CPU models?

You will need Coq 8.3 pl2 (known to work for us as of Nov 6, 2011).
For MIPS, go to MIPSmodel and type make.
For x86, go to x86model and type make.
 
How to build the validation tools?

First, build the x86 CPU model. Then, you will need OCaml 3.12, and pin
(http://www.pintool.org/). Go to the x86model/semantics_trace and type make.
To simulate a binary, you can use the run.sh script. First argument is the
binary, second argument is the symbol that marks the end of the simulation.

How to build the RockSalt C driver?

You will need to install the developer veriosn of native client first. Then,
replace the native_client/src/trustaed/validator_x86/ncval.c file with ours,
make sure the include for tables.h and driver.h are properly set, and build
native client as usual. The resulting ncval binary can run RockSalt by
passing the command line ragument --dfa.
