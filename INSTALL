* How to build the CPU models?

You will need Coq 8.4pl3 (known to work for us as of Dec 12th, 2014).

- For x86, go to x86model and type make.
- For MIPS, go to MIPSmodel and type make.
 
* How to build the validation tools?

First, build the x86 CPU model. Then, you will need OCaml 3.12 (or a more
recent verison), and pin (http://www.pintool.org/). Please go to the
x86model/semantics_trace directory and for further instructions.

* How to build the RockSalt C driver?

You will need to install the developer version of native client first. Then,
replace the native_client/src/trustaed/validator_x86/ncval.c file with ours,
make sure the include for tables.h and driver.h are properly set, and build
native client as usual. The resulting ncval binary can run RockSalt by
passing the command line ragument --dfa.
