How to build the RockSalt C driver?

You will need to install the developer version of native client first. Then,
replace the native_client/src/trustaed/validator_x86/ncval.c file with ours,
make sure the include for tables.h and driver.h are properly set, and build
native client as usual. The resulting ncval binary can run RockSalt by
passing the command line ragument --dfa.
